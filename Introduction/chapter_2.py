# variable named message
message = 'Hello from py3'
print(message)

x = 5
y = 7
z = x* y
print(z)

# variable rules
# 1. variable name can contain only letters, numbers, & underscores. (name cannot start with a number)
# 2. spaces are not allowed in a variable name (use underscore instead)
# 3. do not use python keywords
# 4. variable name should be short and descriptive
# 5. camel case is okay
